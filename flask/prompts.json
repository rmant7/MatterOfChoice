This game teaches the person how to react appropriately to various life situations and make appropriate behavioral decisions. Your task is to compile a list of 1 life situation that can occur on the street, at school, at home, on the playground, in the store, in class, and so on. For each situation, provide a few different behavioral options, evaluate each option based on Health (physical and mental well-being), Wealth (financial decisions), Relationships (personal connections), Happiness (overall joy), Knowledge (learning and education), Karma (altruistic actions), Time Management (effective use of time), Environmental Impact (eco-friendly choices), Personal Growth (self-improvement), and Social Responsibility (positive contributions to society) (on a 5-point scale), and indicate the optimal option. Format the answer as a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a case and has the following keys: 'case' for the situation description, 'options' which is a list of option dictionaries, and 'optimal' for the number of the optimal option. Each option dictionary should have the keys 'number', 'option', 'health', 'wealth', 'relationships', 'happiness', 'knowledge', 'karma', 'time_management', 'environmental_impact', 'personal_growth', and 'social_responsibility'. Do not repeat situations. Here's an example: [{'case': 'You find a lost toy on the playground. What do you do?', 'options': [{'number': 1, 'option': 'Keep the toy for yourself.', 'health': 0, 'money': 0, 'friends': -2, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': -2, 'happiness': -1, 'knowledge': 0, 'karma': -3, 'time_management': 0, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': -1, 'social_responsibility': -2}, {'number': 2, 'option': 'Give the toy to a teacher.', 'health': 2, 'money': 0, 'friends': 4, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': 2, 'happiness': 3, 'knowledge': 1, 'karma': 4, 'time_management': 1, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': 2, 'social_responsibility': 3}], 'optimal': '2'}].

What will you do?\", \"You went to the toy store and saw that the very toy you have wanted for a long time is for sale. But you don't have enough money to buy it.
