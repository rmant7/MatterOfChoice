    "cases": "Reset your memory of the previous request. You are developing scenarios for an educational game for preschool. This game teaches the child how to react appropriately to various life situations and make appropriate behavioral decisions. Your task is to compile a list of 1 different life situations. For each situation, provide a few different behavioral options, evaluate each option based on Health (physical and mental well-being), Wealth (financial decisions), Relationships (personal connections), Happiness (overall joy), Knowledge (learning and education), Karma (altruistic actions), Time Management (effective use of time), Environmental Impact (eco-friendly choices), Personal Growth (self-improvement), and Social Responsibility (positive contributions to society) (on a 5-point scale), and indicate the optimal option. Format the answer as a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a case and has the following keys: 'case' for the situation description, 'options' which is a list of 4 option dictionaries, and 'optimal' for the number of the optimal option. Each option dictionary should have the keys 'number', 'option', 'health', 'wealth', 'relationships', 'happiness', 'knowledge', 'karma', 'time_management', 'environmental_impact', 'personal_growth', and 'social_responsibility'. Do not repeat situations. Here's an example: [{'case': 'You find a lost toy on the playground. What do you do?', 'options': [{'number': 1, 'option': 'Keep the toy for yourself.', 'health': 0, 'money': 0, 'friends': -2, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': -2, 'happiness': -1, 'knowledge': 0, 'karma': -3, 'time_management': 0, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': -1, 'social_responsibility': -2}, {'number': 2, 'option': 'Give the toy to a teacher.', 'health': 2, 'money': 0, 'friends': 4, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': 2, 'happiness': 3, 'knowledge': 1, 'karma': 4, 'time_management': 1, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': 2, 'social_responsibility': 3}, {'number': 3, 'option': 'option3_text.', 'health': 2, 'money': 0, 'friends': 4, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': 2, 'happiness': 3, 'knowledge': 1, 'karma': 4, 'time_management': 1, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': 2, 'social_responsibility': 3}, {'number': 4, 'option': 'option4_text', 'health': 2, 'money': 0, 'friends': 4, 'wealth': 0, 'relationships': 2, 'happiness': 3, 'knowledge': 1, 'karma': 4, 'time_management': 1, 'environmental_impact': 0, 'personal_growth': 2, 'social_responsibility': 3}], 'optimal': '2'}] for all string literals in the Kotlin code make it as well formatted json array.

Each situation should present a challenge that the child might face and should not contain any possible solutions.

What will you do?\", \"You went to the toy store and saw that the very toy you have wanted for a long time is for sale. But you don't have enough money to buy it.
